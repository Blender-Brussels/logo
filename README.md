Blender-Brussels logo
=====================

The Blender-Brussels logo is a mashup of the Python logo and the Blender logo.
The dreadlocks of Blender have been added to the snake's head of Python.
The gradient colors of Python have been flattened to black and white over a mid-gray background to insist on the zen of Python coding inside Blender.

Due to he original licences of the Python and Blender logo, no license can be applied to this creation (so you can do whatever the fuck you want, but if you use it, we would appreciate you state our names and backlink to http://blender-brussels.github.io).

We, the creators of this mashup, would like to state that we did this with no intention of harm against Python and/or Blender Foundation.
This was only done for fun, parody and sole purpose of our workshop communications.

The Python logo is trademark of Python Software Foundation.  
The Blender logo is a copyrighted property of NaN Holding B.V, and has been licensed in 2002 to the Blender Foundation.
